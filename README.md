## 📰 About
A portfolio is a compilation of materials that showcases ones skills, qualifications and projects invonvement. It provides insight into ones personality and work qualifications. With this portfolio, I intend to showcase an online resume website that was developed using the most simplest technologies of Web development: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

#### Home
The main goal of this page is to show that less is more. Today, to catch the users attention, the web page can't have too much information. So the main goal of this page is to seduce the user with a clean design, a proper picture, a simple presentation and a button to see the full resume.
